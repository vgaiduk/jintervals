jintervals format string consists of plain text and codes between `{` and `}`.  The plain text is left untouched, but codes are replaced by interval values.

==Units==

Each code begins with letter, that determines the interval unit.  Currently four units are supported:

 * `{D}` - days
 * `{H}` - hours
 * `{M}` - minutes
 * `{S}` - seconds
